## Contributions

If you have some free time, you can help me with some things.

### Things to do now:

- [x] Add deployment guide. *(No longer needed, we have gradle now)*
- [x] Some things in code need refactoring. *(Little bit by [Vaflan](https://github.com/Vaflan))*
- [ ] Add tests.

*Of course, your propositions are welcome.*
